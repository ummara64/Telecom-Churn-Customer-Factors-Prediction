# Telecom-Churn-Customer-Factors-Prediction

🚀 **Excited to Share My Latest Data Science Project!** 📊

I've recently completed a comprehensive Telecom Churn Prediction and Analysis project using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. 📈✨

🔍 **Key Highlights:**
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Transformed raw telecom data into actionable insights.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized and uncovered key patterns in customer behavior.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Leveraged Logistic Regression and, Random Forest to predict customer churn with high accuracy.
- **Model Tuning:** Optimized model performance using Grid Search.
- **Key Insights:** Identified tenure, total charges, and contract type as major predictors of churn.

This project not only honed my technical skills but also provided valuable business insights to enhance customer retention strategies.
